# Integrated System Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the integrated architecture that connects Work Orders, Wash Transactions, and POS Transactions into a cohesive system. This architecture ensures data continuity and eliminates data silos while maintaining backward compatibility.

## üèóÔ∏è Integrated Architecture

### Data Flow Hierarchy

```
Work Order (Kiosk) ‚Üí Wash Transaction (Service) ‚Üí POS Transaction (Payment)
```

### Core Principles

1. **Work Order**: Customer's order request from kiosk
2. **Wash Transaction**: Service execution record (central hub)
3. **POS Transaction**: Payment processing record

## üìä Database Schema Integration

### Wash Transactions Table (Enhanced)

**New fields added:**

-   `work_order_id` (nullable) - Links to work order
-   `service_status` - Separate from payment status
-   `service_started_at` - When service begins
-   `service_completed_at` - When service ends
-   `queue_number` - Service queue position

### POS Transactions Table (Enhanced)

**New fields added:**

-   `wash_transaction_id` (nullable) - Links to wash transaction
-   `payment_started_at` - Payment process start
-   `payment_verified_at` - Payment verification time
-   `reference_number` - Additional reference

## üîÑ Workflow Integration

### 1. Kiosk Order Workflow

```
Customer Places Order ‚Üí Work Order (pending)
‚Üì
Staff Confirms ‚Üí Work Order (confirmed) + Auto-create Wash Transaction (waiting)
‚Üì
Staff Starts Service ‚Üí Wash Transaction (in_service)
‚Üì
Service Complete ‚Üí Wash Transaction (service_completed)
‚Üì
Customer Pays ‚Üí POS Transaction + Wash Transaction (completed)
```

### 2. Direct Service Workflow

```
Customer Arrives ‚Üí Staff Creates Wash Transaction (waiting)
‚Üì
Service Process ‚Üí Wash Transaction (in_service ‚Üí service_completed)
‚Üì
Payment ‚Üí POS Transaction + Wash Transaction (completed)
```

### 3. Direct Sales Workflow

```
Customer Purchase ‚Üí POS Transaction (no service required)
```

## üîß Model Relationships

### WorkOrder Model

```php
// Relationships
public function washTransactions(): HasMany
public function posTransaction(): HasOne (through wash transaction)

// Key Methods
public function confirmAndCreateWashTransaction(): WashTransaction
public function hasWashTransaction(): bool
public function getActiveWashTransaction()
```

### WashTransaction Model (Enhanced)

```php
// New Relationships
public function workOrder(): BelongsTo
public function posTransaction(): HasOne

// Service Management
public function startService(): void
public function completeService(): void
public function hasPayment(): bool
public function isFromWorkOrder(): bool

// Status Constants
SERVICE_STATUS_WAITING
SERVICE_STATUS_IN_SERVICE
SERVICE_STATUS_COMPLETED
SERVICE_STATUS_CANCELLED
```

### POSTransaction Model (Enhanced)

```php
// New Relationships
public function washTransaction(): BelongsTo
public function workOrder(): BelongsTo (through wash transaction)

// Factory Methods
public static function createFromWashTransaction(WashTransaction $washTransaction, array $paymentData): static

// Helper Methods
public function getSourceType(): string
public function isFromWorkOrder(): bool
public function isFromWashTransaction(): bool
```

## üöÄ API Endpoints Integration

### Work Order Endpoints

-   `POST /api/work-orders/{workOrder}/confirm` - Confirms order and creates wash transaction
-   `GET /api/work-orders` - Includes wash transaction status

### Wash Transaction Endpoints (New)

-   `GET /api/wash-transactions/service-queue` - Service queue management
-   `POST /api/wash-transactions/{washTransaction}/start-service` - Start service
-   `POST /api/wash-transactions/{washTransaction}/complete-service` - Complete service

### POS Transaction Endpoints (Enhanced)

-   `POST /api/pos-transactions/wash-transaction/{washTransaction}/payment` - Process payment for wash transaction
-   `POST /api/pos-transactions/work-order/{workOrder}/payment` - Backward compatibility

## üì± Client Application Integration

### Kiosk Application

1. **Create Work Order**: Customer selects services
2. **Get Queue Number**: System provides queue position
3. **Order Status**: Track confirmation and service progress

### Staff Service Application

1. **View Service Queue**: See pending wash transactions
2. **Start Service**: Update wash transaction to in-service
3. **Complete Service**: Mark service as completed

### POS Application

1. **Process Payments**: For wash transactions or direct sales
2. **View Transaction History**: Integrated view of all transaction types
3. **Sales Reporting**: Comprehensive reporting across all channels

## üîç Benefits of Integration

### Data Consistency

-   Single source of truth for customer transactions
-   Proper audit trail from order to payment
-   Consistent customer experience tracking

### Operational Efficiency

-   Clear separation of order, service, and payment processes
-   Better queue management and service tracking
-   Integrated reporting and analytics

### Scalability

-   Easy to add new channels (mobile app, online ordering)
-   Flexible payment processing
-   Modular service expansion

## üìä Reporting & Analytics

### Integrated Metrics

-   **Order to Service Time**: Work order confirmation to service start
-   **Service Duration**: Service start to completion time
-   **Payment Processing**: Service completion to payment time
-   **Customer Journey**: Complete flow from order to payment

### Business Intelligence

-   **Channel Performance**: Kiosk vs direct vs walk-in sales
-   **Service Efficiency**: Queue management and service times
-   **Payment Analysis**: Payment method preferences and processing times

## üîí Data Integrity

### Referential Integrity

-   Proper foreign key constraints with cascade/set null rules
-   Soft deletes to maintain historical data
-   Audit trails for all status changes

### Business Rules

-   Work order must be confirmed before wash transaction creation
-   Service must be completed before payment processing
-   Payment completion finalizes the entire workflow

## üîÑ Migration Strategy

### Database Migration

1. Run integration migrations to add new fields
2. Update existing data relationships
3. Maintain backward compatibility

### API Migration

1. New endpoints for integrated workflow
2. Legacy endpoints remain functional
3. Gradual migration of client applications

### Testing Strategy

1. Unit tests for model relationships
2. Integration tests for workflow processes
3. End-to-end testing for complete customer journey

## üö® Error Handling

### Workflow Validation

-   Prevent invalid status transitions
-   Validate business rules at each step
-   Proper error messages for client applications

### Data Recovery

-   Soft deletes for data recovery
-   Transaction rollbacks for failed operations
-   Audit logs for troubleshooting

## üìà Performance Optimization

### Database Optimization

-   Proper indexing on foreign keys and status fields
-   Query optimization for complex relationships
-   Caching for frequently accessed data

### API Optimization

-   Eager loading for related models
-   Pagination for large datasets
-   Response caching where appropriate

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live status updates
2. **Mobile Integration**: Mobile app for customers and staff
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Machine learning for service time prediction
4. **Loyalty Integration**: Points and rewards system integration

### Scalability Considerations

1. **Microservices**: Potential service separation for high load
2. **Event Sourcing**: Complete audit trail with event sourcing
3. **Multi-location**: Support for multiple business locations
